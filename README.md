# Flight delay predicion using machine learning

## Problem Statement:

This machine learning project's goal is to analyze and predict flight delays based on weather, precipitation and past aviation data. Given a collection of input data, the goal is to create a predictive model that can accurately predict the possibility of flight delays for future flights.


## Data Description:

This project's dataset will include historical flight data with numerous variables such as departure and arrival airports, scheduled departure time, weather conditions, and other relevant details. The dataset will also include the real departure and arrival timings, as well as whether an aircraft was delayed or not.
